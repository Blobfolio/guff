This is the backing library for the Guff command-line SCSS/CSS parser and minifier. It can be used to compile SCSS into CSS, and/or heavily minify CSS for production use.

Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.rs/guff/) for usage and other details.

**Compatibility**
This library is only compatible with Unix platforms. For broader support, consider using [`grass`](https://crates.io/crates/grass) and [`parcel_css`](https://crates.io/crates/parcel_css) directly.

**Work In Progress**
Both the SASS/SCSS compilation and CSS minification features are works in progress, and might change subtly between releases. To be safe, CSS generated by Guff should be tested in a staging environment before being pushed to production.
