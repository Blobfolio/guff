Guff is a SASS/SCSS parser and CSS minifier rolled into one.

Note: feature-complete SASS/SCSS parsing is still a work in progress. Known issues are tracked [here](https://github.com/connorskees/grass/issues/19).



## Usage

It's easy; just give it a source and, optionally, a destination:
```bash
guff [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]
```

**Flags:**
```text
-h, --help        Print help information and exit.
-V, --version     Print version information and exit.
```

**Options:**
```text
-b, --browsers <STR>  A comma-separated list of specific browser/version pairs
                      to target for CSS compatibility, like 'firefox 90, ie
                      11'. Specifying versions released after guff was built
                      has no effect.
-i, --input <FILE>    The path to an SCSS or CSS source file.
-o, --output <FILE>   The path to save the minified output to. If omitted,
                      the result will be printed to STDOUT instead.
```

If the input is SCSS, it will be processed into CSS and then minified; if it is already CSS, it will just be minified.



## Installation

Debian and Ubuntu users can just grab the pre-built `.deb` package from the [latest release](https://github.com/Blobfolio/guff/releases/latest).

This application is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and can alternatively be built from source using [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo):

```bash
# Clone the source.
git clone https://github.com/Blobfolio/guff.git

# Go to it.
cd guff

# Build as usual. Specify additional flags as desired.
cargo build \
    --bin guff \
    --all-features \
    --release
```

(This should work under other 64-bit Unix environments too, like MacOS.)



## Library

Guff can also be used as a Rust library by adding it to your project's `Cargo.toml` like:

```toml
[dependencies]
guff = "0.1"
```

Refer to the [documentation](docs.rs/guff/) for usage and other details.
