# Guff

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Blobfolio/guff/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Blobfolio/guff/actions)
[![Dependency Status](https://deps.rs/repo/github/blobfolio/guff/status.svg)](https://deps.rs/repo/github/blobfolio/guff)

Guff is a SASS/SCSS parser and CSS minifier rolled into one.



## Usage

It's easy; just give it a source and, optionally, a destination:
```bash
guff [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]
```

**Flags:**
```text
-h, --help        Print help information and exit.
-V, --version     Print version information and exit.
```

**Options:**
```text
-i, --input <FILE>    The path to an SCSS or CSS source file.
-o, --output <FILE>   The path to save the minified output to. If omitted,
                      the result will be printed to STDOUT instead.
```

If the input is SCSS, it will be processed into CSS and then minified; if it is already CSS, it will just be minified.



## Installation

Debian and Ubuntu users can just grab the pre-built `.deb` package from the [latest release](https://github.com/Blobfolio/guff/releases/latest).

This application is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and can alternatively be built from source using [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo):

```bash
# Clone the source.
git clone https://github.com/Blobfolio/guff.git

# Go to it.
cd guff

# Build as usual. Specify additional flags as desired.
cargo build \
    --bin guff \
    --release
```

(This should work under other 64-bit Unix environments too, like MacOS.)
